The project teams will develop a design for a small-scale relational database and subsequently implement the design. 
Once the design phase is completed, students will populate their databases with sample data and run CRUD operations on their databases.


Requirements:
CRUD: Sample queries will demonstrate your understanding of SQL operations. As far as CRUD operations go, we are interested in seeing your sample “read” queries; that is, queries that
make use of the SELECT clause. We ask you to save your SELECT queries in a single .txt file rather than one file for each query. Here is what you need to include in terms of SELECT queries:
- At least 5 queries
- These queries should not make use of the wildcard character (*) unless it is unavoidable
given the nature of the query. If that is the case, and you use the wildcard character (*),
you need to include in your report an explanation about the need for such use in that
query.
- At least four of your queries should involve multiple (two or more) tables, and thus
involve JOIN clauses, (or a subquery, or both).
- At least three of your queries should involve some form of filtering (WHERE, HAVING,
etc.)
- At least two of your queries should involve some form of aggregation over records
(SUM, COUNT, AVERAGE, GROUP BY, etc.) These cannot be queries that simply count
the number of rows in a given table, such as SELECT COUNT(invoice_id) FROM invoices.
- At least one of your queries should use a subquery.
- No two queries should be simple variations of each other. For example, avoid having
two queries that display the same result set, but ordered in two different ways; or avoid
having two queries that count the same set of rows using two different columns.
